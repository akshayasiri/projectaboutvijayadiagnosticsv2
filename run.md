Since this project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you have a few ways to run it:

### Option 1: Direct File Open
1. Navigate to the project directory: `c:\Users\Aksha\projectaboutdiagnostics`
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with** > **Google Chrome** (or your preferred browser).

### Option 2: Using a Local Server (Recommended)
If you have Node.js installed, you can use a local server to ensure all features work correctly:

// turbo
1. Run a simple server:
```powershell
npx serve ./
```
2. Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
If you are using VS Code, install the **Live Server** extension and click the **Go Live** button at the bottom right of the editor while `index.html` is open.
